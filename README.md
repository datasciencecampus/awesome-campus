## Tools & Tutorials


### green spaces

The Green Spaces project is a tool that can render GeoJSON polygons over aerial
imagery and analyse pixels contained within the polygons. Its primary use case
is to determine the vegetation coverage of residential gardens (defined as
polygons in GeoJSON) using aerial imagery stored in OSGB36 format tiles,
although basic support is also present for Web Mercator.

## deploy dashboards

This example creates a simple dash application that reads in a locally-stored file
in data folder and creates a graph from adding and multiplying the numbers in data.csv.
We then deploy it publically to Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

### pygrams

Extracts key terminology (n-grams) from any large collection of
documents (>1000) and forecasts emergence.

### optimus

A text processing pipeline for turning unstructured text data into hierarchical
datasets.

### propeR

A repository for the R tool propeR, which analyses travel time and cost using an
OTP graph. Please see the sister repository
[graphite](https://github.com/datasciencecampus/graphite).

### readpyne

Toolkit for extracting relevant lines from receipts or similar Image data.

## Research

More research focused repos. Often these repos will be the basis for tools
in the above section.

### tron

Detecting collective human behaviour in internet bandwidth consumption data

### access to services

Repository for the Data Science Campus Access to Services project looking at
accessibility of service such as healthcare based on travel times.

See tools: propeR & graphite
